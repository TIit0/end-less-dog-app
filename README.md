# Endless Dog App


Dogs!

## Process:

So, after i did my 24 day challenge on, day 16 i think:  I decided that I really should learn more about Apis and Fetching in general.

1. Learning all the Rest concepts
 
 - I first started by learning all the essential concepts of restful apis. and laying a solid foundation of what i was doing, after I got a good understanding i created a small "beta" of this little page/app. same concept but for cats. you could even upload your cat. ( sadly i lost it when my harddrive died. another reminder i should always upload my stuff to git )


2. Implementing what I learned.

- after i built the cat app, i had a good understanding of what i had to do. so i went ahead and used Another Api ( better practice) and built this app, the focus was not to make my magnum opus, but not make a frankenstein either haha, so i tried to make it look nice and functional
